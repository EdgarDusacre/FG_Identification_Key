# Fishing gear Identification Key

This repository is made to share all the information and files about the "identification key of the fishing gear washed up on the coastlines or collected in the aquatic environment." 

You'll be able to find:
  - The data sheet that resumes the sampling protocol we did to realize the FG Identification Key. 
  - The R code we used to analyze the data. 
  - A datasheet to download to sort the fishing gear you collected during a beach cleaning or the realization of a sampling protocol. 
  - The bank of images we used to create the initial photo guide (actualized when necessary). 
  - The Beaufort scale in French, English and Spanish.

## Using the FG identification key for its structure:

The PLASFITO research project has developed a fishing gear (FG) identification key for plastics found on beaches and in aquatic environments. This initiative aims to address the need for standardized tools to classify fishing-related waste. We strive to share this identification key with as many organizations and research teams developing plastic pollution studies or monitoring programs as possible.

### How to use this FG identification key?

This identification key is designed to be versatile and can be used with a wide range of sampling protocols, from citizen science initiatives to rigorous experimental research studies. To effectively use this key, follow these steps:

    1- Read all the document (35 pages but a lot of images)
    
    2- Download the FG sorting data sheet.
    
    3—Have a look at the open-access bank of images on this repository. It could help you recognize the fishing gear when you sort the collected waste. 
    
    4—Identify with precision the fishing sector-related items you collected during your sampling protocol or beach cleaning. Use the identification key and the photo guide to sort the fishing gear. 
    
    5—Complete the data sheet with all the information. Please make sure to complete all the information/variables of this data sheet. 
    
    6-Send us the data sheet with the following name: FG_IDKey_nameofyourstructure_date (e.g., FG_key_4Pscienseas_160422). Contact: plasfito@4pscienseas.org
    
    7-If you feel that some of your fishing gear are interesting and that they miss our photo guide and bank of images, feel free to send us the pictures. Please be careful to send images of good quality, good luminosity, and good name, along with a signature on each picture if you want to be identified (they will be in open access). Contact: plasfito@4pscienseas.org
    
    8-You can use your data for any work or project. Just cite us!
    
    9-Follow the news of the PLASFITO research project on our Website: https://4pscienseas.org/plasfito/  
    
    10-Please feel free to communicate about this project and disseminate this key and our other work and publications. 

Best wishes.

The whole Plasfito project team wishes you a good mission and thanks you for your action!
