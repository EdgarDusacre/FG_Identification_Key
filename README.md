# Fishing gear Identification Key
This repository is made to share to all the data we collected to create identification key of the fishing gear washed-up on the coastlines are collected in the aquatic environment. 

You'll be able to find:
  - The data sheet that resume the sampling protocol we did to realise the FG Identification Key. 
  - The R code we use to analysed the data. 
  - A data sheet to dowload to sort the fishing gears you collected during a beach cleaning or the realisation of a protocol. 
  - The bank of image we use to create the initial photo guide and that we sometime actualise to upload new images to improve this photo guide. 

## Using the FG identification key for its structure

This identification key is made to improve the existing protocol of macroplastic sampling by bringing a way to classify fishing gear. Therefore it can be use use with any sampling protocol from really basic, to citizen science or rigorous experimental research one. The steps to be able to use this key are:

    1- Read all the document (35 pages but a lot of images)
    
    2- Download the data sheet for the waste sorting at the end of the protocol.
    
    3- Have a look at the open access bank of image on this repository. It could help you to recognise the fishing gear when you will sort the collected wastes. 
    
    4- Sort the items you collected during you sampling protocol or beach cleaning. Use the identification key and the photo guide provided at the end of the document and downloadable on GitHub to sort the fishing gears. 
    
    5- Fill the data sheet will all the information. Please make sure to fill in all the information/variables of this data sheet. 
    
    6- Send us the data sheet with the following name: FG_IDKey_nameofyourstructure_date (e.g. FG_key_4Pscienseas_160422). Contact: plasfito@4pscienseas.org
    
    7- If you feel that some of your fishing gear are interesting and that they miss to our photo guide and bank of image feel free to send us the pictures; Please be careful to send images of good quality, good luminosity, good name and with a signature on each picture if you want to be identified (they will be in open access). Contact: plasfito@4pscienseas.org
    
    8- You can your data for any work or project.
    
    9- Follow the news of the PLASFITO research project on the Website and the improve of this identification key because it should created a database in some month or years. Data on this database will normally be open access. 
    
    10- Please feel free to communicate about this project and disseminate this key and our other work and publications. 

Best wishes, 
The whole Plasfito project's team wishes you a good mission and thanks you for your action!
